### ✅ **Post Content:**

Learning Python becomes fun when you start creating real-world projects!
Today, I built a **Simple Calculator using Python** that can perform basic arithmetic operations like:
✔ Addition
✔ Subtraction
✔ Multiplication
✔ Division

**✨ How it works:**
✅ Take two numbers as input
✅ Select the desired operation
✅ Display the result instantly

This project is perfect for beginners to understand **conditional statements and user input in Python**.

🎥 **Watch the video to see the full demo!**

✅ Do you want me to **add an engaging thumbnail caption** for your calculator video (e.g., “Build Your Own Calculator in Python!”) and **suggest image ideas for your LinkedIn post**? Or should I make **a carousel post outline** (Slide 1 → Intro, Slide 2 → Code, Slide 3 → Output)?
